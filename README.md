# DataVisualization 
The main objective of this project is to implement the Wide World Importers (WWI) data warehouse and establish the essential infrastructure to support Business Intelligence (BI) solutions. The project will encompass the following key phases:

Data Warehouse Design and Development: In this phase, the focus will be on designing and developing a robust database structure that accommodates the necessary data formats and relationships. The data will be extracted from various business processes and transactions within WWI and loaded into the database.

Data Integration: The data warehouse will be seamlessly integrated with other data sources and systems. This integration ensures that the data remains current and coherent across all connected sources.

BI Solutions: This phase involves proposing and visualizing BI solutions within the data warehouse. These solutions will enhance the company's understanding of the data stored in the WWI dataset, providing valuable insights.

Testing and Deployment: Rigorous testing will be conducted on both the data warehouse and the BI solutions. This step ensures that all components fulfill the specified requirements and perform as intended. Once testing is complete, the data warehouse and BI solutions will be deployed for active use.
